            <p>The Amir went on: "I do not come here so that our Master should attend to me and converse with me. My purpose in coming is to have the honor of being amongst the company of his servants." For example, just now you were preoccupied and did not show yourself until you had kept me waiting for a long time. This was so I would realize how difficult and disagreeable it is if I keep others waiting when they come to my door and I do not readily admit them. You have made me taste the bitterness of that and have given me a lesson so that I will not act like that with others.</p>

<p>Rumi answered: That's not true. <br>
On the contrary, my keeping you waiting is an expression of utmost loving-kindness. Just as God declares, O my child, I would answer your smallest petition and slightest complaint without delay, if it weren't that the voice of your complaint is so sweet to my ears. My answer lingers unspoken in hopes that you might complain again and again, for the sound of your voice is so sweet to me. <br>
For example, two beggars come to the door of a certain person. One is highly loved and sought after, while the other is not that much liked. The owner of the house says to a slave, Give that hated one a piece of bread quickly and without delay, so he will leave right away. To the other beloved beggar the owner makes promises, saying, The bread is not yet baked. Wait patiently until the bread is properly cooked and baked.</p>

<p>From Fihi Ma Fihi (Discourse of Jalaluddin Rumi)</p>
