            <p>The Amir said: 'The root of the matter is action'.</p>

<p>Rumi said: Where are such people of action, so that I can teach them action? But now look how you cock your ears, seeking after words instead of action. If I were to stop speaking now, you would become upset. Become a seeker of action, so that I can show you action! <br>
I am looking all over the world for students of action so that I can teach action. I am looking all over the world for anyone who knows action, but I find no student of action only of words, and so I occupy myself with words. <br>
What do you know of action? Action is only known through action. There is not one traveler upon this road, it is empty so how will anyone see if we are on the true path of action? After all, prayer and fasting are not actions; these are forms of action. <br>
Action is an inward reality. From the time of Adam(PBH) to the time of Mohammed(PBH), prayer and fasting have changed their form, but action is still the same. Action is not what people think it is. People believe action is this outward show. But if a hypocrite performs only the form of action, such as prayer or fasting, it gains them nothing, since the sincere desire for true action was not present. <br>
The secret principle of all things is speech and words. You do not yet know the true knowledge of speech and words, therefore you consider them unimportant. However, speech is fruit from the tree of action, for words are born of action. <br>
God created the world by a word. You may have faith in your heart, but unless you share it through words, it is worth nothing. When you say, In this present age words are of no account, you say this with words, do you not? <br>
If words are of no account then why do we hear you say this with words?</p>
