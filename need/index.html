Care your soul. Too much caring your body causes your soul to be weakened...to die. When the rider is to go towards the destiny what good of the horse if the rider is just sleeping on it not caring where it goes? You must have the control of your horse when you are riding on it. Don't let it to be just a runner. You may fall down from it and you will die before reaching the destiny. So this is the right time to wake up. Take care of your soul. <br />
You are just in time. Important are the words. You see if the words are for you. <br />
We are naturally in a path of purification. Sometimes we know and sometimes we know not. Not any of our phase is permanent unless we are purified. Our pains proof that this is not the ultimate phase. <br />
You may suffer from a disease knowing and without knowing that the disease is in your body. But the doctor knows. So he is telling you to be careful even when you are not in the pain. Because he knows that someday it will come. When you are the sufferer it is eventual to look for a doctor. There is a doctor in you who will take you to the real doctor. You just need to activate the doctor in you. This is the only thing you are to do. Give your doctor the freedom to look for a true doctor. <br />
You are already helped. You were never helpless. <br />
Troubles come for two reasons. Either it is your punishment or it is that you are in the process and overcoming it you will be honored as a winner of examination. Both are good for you. Punishments are for Allah wants your purification through it and examination is only for the selected peoples who will be given better responsibilities. It is an honor it is a Love. Allah is hoping that you will be purified through the punishment. It is also for Love. He wants you to know the reality of pain when purity impurity mixes. Love is pure. When pure and impure mixes, it makes the pain. Pain purifies you. Are you still in the pain? If you are, it means both are in you now living together, Love and impurity. If either of that two disappears, you will feel no pain. <br />
Ultimately the creation is Loved.</p>
